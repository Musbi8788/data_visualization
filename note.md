# Generating date
 * The pyplot module contains a number of functions that generate charts and plots
* subplot can generate one or more plot in the same figure.
  
# Correnting the plot x coodinate
you can change the x conodinat by generating your own like this 
```.plot(input_values, squares, linewidth=3)```
